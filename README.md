# Pandas
## Prepared By: Aaron Galloway

## Overview:
Used CSV data and Pandas Dataframes to determine:
- The annualized standard deviation (252 trading days) for all portfolios.
- The plotted rolling standard deviation using a 21 trading day window for all portfolios.
- The calculated annualized Sharpe Ratios and the accompanying bar plot visualization.
- A correlation table.

In addition a custom portfolio was created and added to the DataFrame and compared with the other portfolios in the Dataframe
